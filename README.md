# omegga-raytracer-cr

![Sample render](https://i.imgur.com/9DRgc2P.png)

Effectively a port of [omegga-raytracer](https://github.com/voximity/omegga-raytracer) using omegga-cr.
This version, written in Crystal, is substantially faster. It also has support for meshes, meaning it should be trivial to add new bricks like wedges, ramps, or even non-procedural bricks.

## Installation

First, install [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/). Then,

`omegga install gh:voximity/raytracer-cr`

## Usage

See the original plugin above for usage instructions.
